# `BigStack - an RPN Calculator`


An [RPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) calculator. Built as a progressive web app [PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) with the intention that it be installed on a phone or mobile device. Works great on the desktop as well.
